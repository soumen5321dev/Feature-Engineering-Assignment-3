    "\n",
    "1. Nature of the Data (Nominal vs. Ordinal)\n",
    "Species, Habitat, and Diet are most likely nominal variables. This means they represent categories that do not have\n",
    "an inherent order (e.g., species like \"lion,\" \"tiger,\" \"elephant\"; habitats like \"forest,\" \"desert,\" \"ocean\"; diets\n",
    "like \"herbivore,\" \"carnivore,\" \"omnivore\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Common Encoding Techniques for Nominal Data:\n",
    "(i)One-Hot Encoding: This is typically the preferred method for encoding nominal data. One-Hot Encoding converts\n",
    "each unique category into a separate binary column, ensuring that the model does not mistakenly interpret any\n",
    "ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)Label Encoding: This assigns an integer to each unique category. However, this can be problematic with nominal\n",

    "for nominal data unless you're working with tree-based models that don't rely on the numerical magnitude of encoded\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Consideration:\n",
    "(i)For Linear Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks):\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding is ideal because these models interpret numerical inputs as having a magnitude. Assigning numerical\n",
    "labels to categorical data (as in Label Encoding) could introduce unintended ordinal relationships that could\n",
    "confuse the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)For Tree-Based Models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting):\n",
    "Label Encoding could be a viable option because tree-based models split data based on the category, not on any\n",
    "inherent order. The models do not treat the numerical labels as ordered, so Label Encoding works well in these\n",
    "cases, especially when dealing with a high number of categories, which would make One-Hot Encoding computationally\n",
    "expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "Assume you are building a classification model to predict whether an animal is endangered based on features like\n",
    "species, habitat, and diet.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding:\n",

    "Diet: [\"Herbivore\", \"Carnivore\", \"Omnivore\"]\n",

    "Species would be encoded into 3 binary columns: [\"Lion\", \"Tiger\", \"Elephant\"].\n",
    "Habitat would be encoded into 3 binary columns: [\"Forest\", \"Desert\", \"Ocean\"].\n",
    "Diet would be encoded into 3 binary columns: [\"Herbivore\", \"Carnivore\", \"Omnivore\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a dataset where each category is represented independently, without introducing any ordinal bias. This\n",
    "approach is particularly suitable for linear models that require numerical input and expect independence between\n",
    "categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding (if using tree-based models):\n",
    "\n",
    "Species: [\"Lion\" → 0, \"Tiger\" → 1, \"Elephant\" → 2]\n",
    "Habitat: [\"Forest\" → 0, \"Desert\" → 1, \"Ocean\" → 2]\n",
    "Diet: [\"Herbivore\" → 0, \"Carnivore\" → 1, \"Omnivore\" → 2]\n",
